# Problem Statement

The project aims to develop an advanced algorithm for dynamically rerouting vehicles in a simulated urban traffic network. The primary objectives are to:

- Minimize traffic congestion
- Reduce overall travel time
- Provide adaptive routing based on real-time traffic conditions

# Run Project Locally

1. Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/ChitrakshTarun/Dynamic-Traffic-Routing-System.git
```

2. Compile the project.

```
gcc -o traffic_router main.c graph.c utils.c
```

3. Run the generated .exe to simulate the dynamic traffic routing system.
