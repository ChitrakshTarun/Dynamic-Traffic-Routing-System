# Problem Statement

The project aims to develop an advanced algorithm for dynamically rerouting vehicles in a simulated urban traffic network. The primary objectives are to:

- Minimize traffic congestion
- Reduce overall travel time
- Provide adaptive routing based on real-time traffic conditions
